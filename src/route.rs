//! The policy seam: one trait, [`RoutePolicy`], that turns a request into a
//! [`Route`] (which model, at what level, in what modality, with what
//! confidence). This is the boundary that decomplects mechanism from brain:
//! `hanzo-router` owns the mechanism (registry, SLO gate, placement, dispatch);
//! a learned policy (the `enso` crate) owns the brain and implements this trait.
//!
//! The rule-based [`crate::policy::Policy`] implements it too, as the cold-start
//! fallback — so a deployment routes sensibly before any eval data exists, and a
//! learned policy can delegate to it when it has no profiles for a pool.
