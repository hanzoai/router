//! Piece 3/6: the learnable utility. `utility(x, p) = x^T W p` -- a bilinear
//! form that scores how well profile `p` serves request `x`. `W` is the only
//! offline-learned object; per-user adaptation is a delta on `W` produced by the
//! [`crate::learner`] and applied here through [`Policy::utility_with`].
//!
//! The bilinear form is deliberately the whole model: with the task one-hot in
//! `x` and quality-by-task in `p`, `W` learns the task->quality alignment that
//! routing needs, and stays a single matrix the bandit can update online. A
//! small MLP head would attach at this same seam (score `phi = vec(x p^T)`
//! through an MLP instead of a dot) without touching any other piece; the linear
//! head is what the proof needs and what the online learner stays convex over.
