//! # enso
//!
//! enso is the learned **policy** (the brain) for `hanzo-router` (the mechanism).
//! `hanzo-router` owns the registry, the SLO gate, placement and dispatch and
//! exposes one seam -- the [`RoutePolicy`] trait. enso implements it, turning a
//! request into a [`Route`] (which model, at what level, in what modality, with
//! what confidence), and falls back to the router's rule-based policy until it
//! has eval data.
//!
//! Six orthogonal pieces, one concern each:
//! 1. [`featurize`] -- request -> feature vector `x` (hashing, sub-microsecond).
//! 2. [`profile`] -- eval rows `p` per (model, level, modality); `eval_ingest`.
//! 3. [`policy`] -- the learnable bilinear utility `x^T W p`.
//! 4. [`guard`] -- a two-tier safety gate (hot path + escalation seam).
//! 5. [`selector`] -- safety-gated, SLO-feasible constrained argmax.
//! 6. [`learner`] -- offline ridge fit of `W` + online per-user LinUCB.
//!
//! The registry is cross-modal: LLMs, dub generators and image models are all
//! just rows -- adding a model is adding a row.
//!
//! Real eval data plugs in at [`profile::parse_jsonl`] / [`profile::ingest`]
//! (point them at a bench's JSONL); absent that, [`synth`] emits clearly-labeled
//! synthetic tuples so the mechanism is provable today.
